Steam lib compare
---

This is an application that will compare 2 (or more) Steam libraries for overlapping games. I made this because it was always a hassle to find games to play with my friends.

Technicly there are 2 sperate web applications that both have to run to work
- The laravel backend that will work with the steam api.
- And an angular frontend.

I am not planning to continue working on this project. It was a fun side project and it was a good introduction to laravel and angular.
